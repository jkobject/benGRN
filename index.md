# BenGRN

Awesome Benchmark of Gene Regulatory Networks created by @jkobject

The package is supposed to work with [GRnnData](https://cantinilab.github.io/GRnnData/)
It can run Genie3 & pyscenic on your data as a comparison

It has 4 different types of key ground truth data to compare your GRN to:
- sushmita roy's ChIP+Perturb ground truth
- collectri's literature curated ground truth
- dorothea's literature curated ground truth
- tf2gene's chip curated ground truth
